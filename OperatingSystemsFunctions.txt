Personally, I think Windows is the most popular computer OS. 
Operating system types include Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. 
I usually use Windows as a computer operating system. 
An operating system can be defined as an "executive administrator", a part of a computer system that manages all hardware and all software. 
Because an operating system manages who can use the system and how it can be used, the operating system is the boss that manages the computer system.
